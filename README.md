### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Denis, deeply involved in building an advanced medical transportation platform. In my tech toolkit, I work with Node.js, Ruby, a bit of Java, Angular, and React. As a Tech Lead, I guide teams to success, fostering growth and experience.

My interests include functional programming (especially 'OCaml') and exceptional UX design. Occasionally, I explore networking with Go Lang and delve into Lisp (Racket). Looking back, it's amusing to recall my early career experiments with nearly every PHP framework out there! ðŸ˜„
