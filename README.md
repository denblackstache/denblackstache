### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Denis, deeply involved in building an advanced medical transportation platform. In my tech toolkit, I work with Ruby, Node.js, Java and Angular. As a Tech Lead, I guide teams to success, fostering growth and experience.

My interests include functional programming, particularly with Clojure, and the creation of exceptional UI/UX.
